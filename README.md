 - A simple clone of a classic memory game.  Android 2.2+ -
 
 I wrote this mostly to familiarize myself with the Android SDK and Eclipse.
 If you have Eclipse + ADT + 2.2 API, it should build and load.  Currently
 the game just runs for ten rounds.  It's pretty much as basic as it could
 be in terms of function and interface, but it's technically playable.  I
 created some custom sounds for each button in Audacity.  In case anyone cares,
 I think they're in the key of A major.  There are also sounds for winning
 and losing the game, but they play very quickly and are easy to miss.  The
 game could use some kind of a pause at the beginning of each round.
 
 FWIW, I have tested it on my Galaxy S2, which is currently running
 CyanogenMod 10.1.2 (Android 4.2.2).  Everything works, except the lowest tone
 that plays when the yellow square is tapped is nearly inaudible when played
 through my phone's speaker.
